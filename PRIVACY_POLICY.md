Fajr Buddy ("we," "our," or "us") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how our Android application uses your data.

Overlay (Display over other apps): Used solely to display the full-screen alarm interface when the device is locked or another app is open.

Wakelock & Exact Alarm: Used to ensure the alarm rings at the precise time you set, regardless of battery saving modes.

Vibration: Used for haptic feedback and alarm vibration.

3. Children’s Privacy

Our app does not address anyone under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children.
